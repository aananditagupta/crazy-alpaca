## Which Browsers/Devices or Virtualisation services did you check the application in?
I used the responsive option in the browser to check for phone and tablet, my breakpoints are set for 600px to ensure a smooth transition for smaller screens.

## What did you think of this test/exercise?
### What did you like?
1. I liked the clarity of instructions given
2. The project in general had a set of desirable instructions but it also allowed for creative freedom - this is also something I appreciated a lot

Due to some urgent work commitments, I was delayed in finishing the test but it took me roughly 1-2 days to finish the assignment. 

I would improve my solution by making it more interactive. One of the things i wanted to add was WebGL based artwork but decided against as that would make the application heavy and make a longer load time. With the help of this projet, this is something I am able to research and understand how to reduce size without affecting quality.
